## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m **Rasel Shikdar**, a Full-Stack Web Developer with a focus on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I love building apps, writing clean code, and sharing what I learn along the way.

I actively contribute to open-source ideas, clone full-stack projects for practice, and enjoy solving real-world problems using modern web technologies. I also manage [my personal portfolio site](https://raselsh.site), where you can explore all of my work in one place.
