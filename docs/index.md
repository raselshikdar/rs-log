    - A theme customized based on VitePress 🎨
    - Never forget why you started, no matter how long you've been on the journey
    - Life is like a journey of cultivation; you can’t achieve perfection from the beginning
    - No matter how heavy the burden, don’t forget to smile; no matter how long the journey, don’t forget to persist
    - The essence of life lies not in prosperity, but in simplicity
